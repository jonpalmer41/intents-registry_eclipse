      The Intents Registry Eclipse Plug-in allows developers to browse an online intents registry provided by OpenIntents and insert a code block corresponding to the selected intents directly into their Eclipse project. At the heart of this software is an intents registry. This registry, much like a typical XML data source, defines all of the unique intents both actions and titles used throughout the plug-in. Using combinations of actions and titles we can define intents.
